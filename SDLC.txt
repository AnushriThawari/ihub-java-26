SDLC
=====
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

It is a process adopt by IT industries to develop accurate and quality of software.

There are six phases in SDLC.

1)Feasibility study 

2)Analysis 

3)Designing 

4)Coding 

5)Testing 

6)Delivery and Maintainence 

1)Feasibility study 
-------------------
Feasibility study phase completely depends upon TELOS formulea.
ex:
	T - Technical feasibility
	E - Economical feasibility
	L - Legal feasibility
	O - Operational feasibility
	S - Schedule feasibility 

All the above information we will keep in a document called BDD.

Here BDD stands for Business Design Document.

2)Analysis
----------
In analysis phase, system analyst or product owner will involved.

They will seperate system requirements and software requirements.

The will keep the above information in a document called SRS.

Here SRS stands for Software Requirement Specification.


3)Designing 
------------
We have two types of designing.

1)High level designing 
----------------------
A manager is responsible to perform high level designing.

In high level designing we will design main/major modules.

2)Low level designing 
--------------------
A team lead/project lead is responsible to perform low level designing.

In low level designing , we will design child/sub modules.

All the above information they will keep in a document called PDD/TDD.

Here PDD stands for Project Design Document.
Here TDD stands for Technical Design Document.


4) Coding
------------
In coding phase, developers will involved.

A developer is responsible to generate the build(code).

After developing the build , a programmer is liable to perform white box testing.


5) Testing phase 
--------------
In testing phase, testing team or QA team will involved.

The test the build they will write test code and they do testing. 

Once the test code is done ,they are responsible to perform black box testing.


6) Delivery and Maintainence
----------------------------
Before delivery company performs UAT testing. 

UAT stands User Acceptance Testing.

It is divided into two types.

i) Alpha Testing

ii) Beta Testing
