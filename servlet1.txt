Servlets
========

Web Application
===============
A web application is a collection of web resource programs having the capability to generate web pages.

Diagram: servlet1.1

We have two types of web pages.

1) Static web page / passive web page 
--------------------------------------
A web page with fixed content is called static web page.
ex:
	home page 
	aboutus page
	services page 
	contactus page 
	and etc.

2) Dynamic web page / active web page 
--------------------------------------
A web page with dynamic content is called dynamic web page.
ex:
	live cricket score page 
	stock market share value page 
	gmail inbox page 
	and etc.

We have two types of web resource programs.

1) Static web resource program 
-------------------------------
A web resource program which is used to develop static web pages is called static web resource program.
ex:
	html program 
	css program
	bootstrap program
	angularjs program
	reactjs program
	and etc.

2) Dynamic web resource program 
------------------------------
A web resource program which is used to develop dynamic web pages is called 
dynamic web resource program.
ex:
	servlet program
	jsp program
	and etc.

Based on the position and execution these web resource programs are divided into two types.

1)Client side web resource program
---------------------------------
A web resource program which executes at client side(Browser window) is called client side web resource program.
ex:
	html program
	css program
	bootstrap program
	javascript program
	angularjs program
	reactjs program

All static web resource programs are also known as client side web resource programs.


2)Server side web resource program 
-----------------------------------
A web resource program which executes at server side is called server side web 
resource program.
ex:
	Servlet program
	Jsp program
	and etc.

All dynamic web resource programs are also known as server side web resource programs.


Web Application and Web Resource program execution
==================================================
Java program will execute manually.

Web application and web resource program will execute at the time when they have requested.Hence there is no chance to execute them manually.

Diagram: servlet1.2

With respect to the diagram:

1) Enduser will give the request to web resource program.

2) Web server will trap that request and passes that request to appropriate web   
   resource program.

3) Web resource program will execute the logic to process the request.

4) Web resource program will communicate with database software if necesarry.

5) Web resource program sends the output to web server.

6) Web server will send the output to browser window as dynamic response.

Note:
------
The process of keeping the web application inside the server is called deployment and reverse is called undeployment.


Web Server
==========
A web server is a piece of software which is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.

ex:
	Tomcat , Resin , Web logic, GlassFish , Jboss, Wildfly and etc.

Responsibilities of web server 
-------------------------------
1) It takes contineous request from client.

2) It will pass request to appropriate web resource program.

3) It provides environment to deploy and undeploy the web application.

4) It will add middleware services only to deployed web application.

5) It provides environment to execute client side web resource programs at browser   
   window.

6) It will take the output from web resource program and send to browser window 
   as dynamic response.

7) It automates whole process of web application and web resource program execution.

Note:
------
To execute java program we required JRE/JVM.

To execute servlet program we required servlet container.

To execute jsp program we required jsp container.

Web Container
=============
It is a software application or a program which is used to manage whole life cycle of web resource program i.e from birth to death.

Servlet container manage whole life cycle of servlet program.

Jsp container manage whole life cycle of jsp program.

Some part of industry considers servlet container and jsp container are web containers.

Every server is designed to support servlet container and jsp container.



Tomcat
=======

Server			:	Web Server 

Vendor			:	Apache Foundation 

website			:	www.tomcat.apache.org

Port No			:	8080

Servlet container	:	Cataline 

Jsp container		:	Jasper

Tomcat installation will ask following things.

1) HTTP connector portno

2) Adminstrator username and password 

3) JRE location (parallel to JDK)

4) Tomcat installation location



Servlet
========
It is a web resource program which enhance the functionality of web server, proxy server or IDE's server.

or

It is a java based dynamic web resource program which is used to generated dynamic web pages.

or

It is a single instance multithread java based web resource program which is used to develop web applications.

Servlet API
===========
API is a collection of packages.
ex:
	javax.servlet 
	javax.servlet.http
